# DescIndex
**D**escriptive **I**ndex generator

## How to use
Well it's really simple:
For every file you have, add a file with equal name + `.txt` appended and fill it like this:

    This is the title
    This is a description.
    It's multi-line!

Also, put a file named `desc.txt` with the same syntax into each folder. It's what describes the folder itself.
